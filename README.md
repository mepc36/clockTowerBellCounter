## App Description:

This is an app that will count the number of times a bell will ring between the user's two chosen times. 

The app's tech stack is as follows:

-React.js front end, for a single page app;
-Webpack bundler, in order to reconcile browser vendor conflicts;
-Express server to serve up the static files;
-React's Styled Components module, for CSS;
-AirBnB, for a style guide (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Installation:

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:
- npm init
- npm install

Make Webpack build its bundle.js file in /public by running the following command:

- npm run build

Make the server load up the static files from the /public folder on port 3000 with the following command:

- npm run start

## Usage:

1. Navigate to localhost: 3000 and select a "From" time and a "To" time from the drop down menus. 
2. The interpreter will display a window alert if 2 full times — both minutes, and hours — are not selected. 
3. Click the "Calculate Bell Rings!" button to have the number of intervening bell rings displayed.
